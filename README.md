## Local Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

If you want to set up a development environment for the project , you need these:

```
brew install node@18.12.1
```

\*Note: Especially for Node, I strongly recommend usage of a Node version management tool such as [Volta](https://volta.sh).

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/TomLisankie/blog-qwik.git

cd blog-qwik

# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev environment
npm start
```
